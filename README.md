# Det-Fly
The problem of air-to-air visual detection of micro unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) by monocular cameras is important for many tasks such as vision-based swarming of UAVs, malicious UAV detection, and see-and-avoid systems for UAVs. 
We present a new dataset, named Det-Fly, which consists of more than 13,000 images of a flying target UAV acquired by another flying UAV. 
Compared to the existing datasets, the proposed one is systematically designed and more comprehensive in the sense that it covers a wide range of practical scenarios with different background scenes, viewing angles, relative distance, flying altitude, and lightning conditions.
